Hi! Welcome to **Talk Like a President**.  
This app uses simple NLP to rewrite your sentence in the style of real U.S. Presidents, based on their **inaugural addresses** â€” whether they served one or two terms.

**How to use**
1. Choose a President from the dropdown.
2. Type any sentence.
3. Click **Translate**.

Youâ€™ll see:
- ðŸ§± **Basic Rewriter** â€” swaps vocabulary using that presidentâ€™s inauguration speech.
- ðŸ§  **POS-Based Rewriter** â€” mimics grammar, structure, and tone inspired by their rhetoric.

*Educational demo â€” apolitical; not affiliated with any government or campaign.*
